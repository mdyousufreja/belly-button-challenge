# belly-button-challenge


## Background ## 

In this assignment, I was tasked to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Files ##

Downloaded the following files to get started:

[Module 14 Challenge files](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/3819/assignments/56644?module_item_id=1000218)

## Instructions ##

Completed the following steps:

1. Used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.
